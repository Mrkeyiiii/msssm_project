\section{Implementation}
The implementation of the model presented in Section \ref{sec:4-model} was based on the code from \cite{Hardmeier2012}. Since the code of \cite{Hardmeier2012} implements the social force model exactly as it is presented in \cite{Helbing2000}, it was appropriate to take the code of \cite{Hardmeier2012} as a starting point and make the necessary additions and alterations according to the model modifications of \cite{Zainuddin2010} and \cite{Wang2016}. Most of these additions and alterations warrant no particular explanation, and in general were made according to the model of Section \ref{sec:4-model}.

The point that will be discussed in detail is the calculation of the congested radii $r_k(t)$ around each exit, from \eqref{eq:Uik}. This point was not discussed at all in \cite{Zainuddin2010} or \cite{Wang2016} and therefore a new implementation was needed.
