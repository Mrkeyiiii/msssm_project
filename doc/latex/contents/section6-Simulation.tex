\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}
All simulations were carried out using the forward Euler method to numerically solve the differential equations of our model. The step size of the solver was constant for each simulation and was chosen so that the corresponding simulation was stable. The parameters that were used for the simulations are presented in Table \ref{tab:param}, most of which were adapted from~\citet{Wang2016} (with few alterations, wherever needed). The values of said parameters stem both from empirical data and from expected values of the quantities they represent, for further details regarding this point the reader is referred to~\citet{Helbing2000},~\citet{Zainuddin2010} and~\citet{Wang2016}. Any parameter that is not present in Table \ref{tab:param} or that was changed for a particular simulation will be mentioned in the corresponding simulation subsection.

	\caption{Simulation parameters' values. A range of values instead of a singular value denotes that the values of that particular parameter were chosen randomly for each agent using a uniform distribution on that range. A singular value for a parameter that is agent-dependent denotes that all agents have the same parameter value.}

\subsection{Panic Level}
In order to determine how the panic level of the agents' affect their behaviour and the evacuation time, multiple simulations were conducted with various panic levels $p_i$. The panic level that was used was the same for all agents in each simulation, and therefore will be henceforth denoted as just $p$. The simulations were conducted in an arena with two exits of width $\SI{4.7}{\meter}$, $N=600$ agents, and the parameter $\alpha_i=0.6$ for all agents was used.

The panic level $p$ affects how much each agent's speed is affected by the speed of the agents' speed around him (in a $\SI{2}{\meter}$ radius), therefore it is a measure of how susceptible each agent is to the behaviour of everyone around him. A value of $p=0$ would mean that each agent behaves in a completely individualistic way, whereas a value of $p=1$ would mean that the agents behave in a pure herding way. In general, in an urgent evacuation scenario where the agents are considerably panicked the panic level $p$ will be high, whereas in a relaxed non-urgent evacuation scenario the panic level will be low.

First, an initial simulation for the singular value of $p = 0.4$ was conducted. Four frames from the $\SI{60}{\second}$ simulation are presented in Figure \ref{fig:demo_P-0.4}. At $t=\SI{0}{\second}$, Figure \ref{fig:demo_P-0.4_a}, each agent evaluates the best exit and starts moving towards it. At $t=\SI{4}{\second}$, Figure \ref{fig:demo_P-0.4_b}, the agents have separated into two distinct groups, one heading towards the green exit and one heading towards the teal exit. At $t=\SI{8}{\second}$, Figure \ref{fig:demo_P-0.4_c}, the agents have reach both exits and they start evacuating. At $t=\SI{12}{\second}$, Figure \ref{fig:demo_P-0.4_d}, it can be seen that an arch-like blocking of both exits has taken place. This is consistent with empirical observations of evacuation procedures of large groups of people~\cite{Helbing2000}. The whole evacuation procedure, until all $600$ agents have evacuated the arena, takes $\SI{21}{\second}$.

Next, in order to see the effect of different values of the panic level $p$ on the total evacuation time, multiple simulations were conducted with values of $p$ in the range $[0,0.9]$. For each value of $p$ in this range, $10$ different simulations were conducted and the mean evacuation of time was taken, in order to reduce the randomness induced by the random parameters and initializations of each simulation. The resulting evacuation times are presented in Figure \ref{fig:demo_P}. It is evident that an upward trend between the panic level and the evacuation time is present. The higher the panic level of the agents, the longer it takes them to evacuate the arena. This results also is consistent with empirical scenarios, where a crowd with a higher panic level takes longer to evacuate an area compared to a peaceful and relaxed evacuation. Additionally, the relation between the panic level and the evacuation time over the intervals $p \in [0,0.3]$ and $p \in [0.4,0.9]$ could clearly be approximated with a linear model.
