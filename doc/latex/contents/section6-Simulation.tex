\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}
All simulations were carried out using the forward Euler method to numerically solve the differential equations of our model. The step size of the solver was constant for each simulation and was chosen so that the corresponding simulation was stable. The parameters that were used for the simulations are presented in Table \ref{tab:param}, most of which were adapted from~\citet{Wang2016} (with few alterations, wherever needed). Any parameter that is not present in Table \ref{tab:param} or that was changed for a particular simulation will be mentioned in the corresponding simulation subsection.
