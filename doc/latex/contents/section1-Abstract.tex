\section{Abstract} \label{sec:1-abstract}
In this project we consider the problem of modelling and simulating an evacuation procedure scenario through the social force model. Starting from the work of \citet{Helbing2000}, we study and incorporate the work of \citet{Zainuddin2010} and \citet{Wang2016} on the social force model. We identify three key parameters whose effect on the output of our model we consider important and formulate our research questions accordingly. We define our model and implement it, starting from the work of \citet{Hardmeier2012}. We perform multiple simulations to test the behaviour of our model and to answer the research questions stated. We finally summarize our work and its results.
